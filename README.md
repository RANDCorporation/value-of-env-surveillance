# Genomic Surveillance Value of Information Code Repository

## About this repository

This repository contains code to explore the Value of Information of Genomic sequencing technologies using infectious disease models.

## Next Tasks

*Manuscript*

**Introduction**

- [] Review 

**Methods**

**Results**

**Discussion**

**Supplementary Appendix**

- [] Model Section
- [] Table of parameters

*Model Implementation*

- [] Implement c19model R6 class for the odin model [Pedro]
- [] Implement first version of a multi-jurisdiction stochastic model.
- [] Implement NPIs on the multi-jurisdiction model.

TBD tasks:
- [] Possibly implement testing and wastewater surveillance explicitly (it is unclear if that will be useful. It might be useful we we impose a testing constraint, but it may have a negligible effect during the onset of a surge).

*Model Inputs*

- [] Create table of model parameters following Laura's document. Find References whenever appropriate. This table should be read into the model appendix file.
- [] Code mobility matrix creation using Derek's mobility information.
